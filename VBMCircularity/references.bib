	Abstract = {Recent discussions within the neuroimaging community have highlighted the problematic presence of selection bias in experimental design. Although initially centering on the selection of voxels during the course of fMRI studies, we demonstrate how this bias can potentially corrupt voxel-based analyses. For such studies, template-based registration plays a critical role in which a representative template serves as the normalized space for group alignment. A standard approach maps each subject's image to a representative template before performing statistical comparisons between different groups. We analytically demonstrate that in these scenarios the popular sum of squared difference (SSD) intensity metric, implicitly surrogating as a quantification of anatomical alignment, instead explicitly maximizes effect size-an experimental design flaw referred to as "circularity bias." We illustrate how this selection bias varies in strength with the similarity metric used during registration under the hypothesis that while SSD-related metrics, such as Demons, will manifest similar effects, other metrics which are not formulated based on absolute intensity differences will produce less of an effect. Consequently, given the variability in voxel-based analysis outcomes with similarity metric choice, we caution researchers specifically in the use of SSD and SSD-related measures where normalization and statistical analysis involve the same image set. Instead, we advocate a more cautious approach where normalization of the individual subject images to the reference space occurs through corresponding image sets which are independent of statistical testing. Alternatively, one can use similarity terms that are less sensitive to this bias. Hum Brain Mapp, 2012. {\copyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	Abstract = {We introduce Atropos, an ITK-based multivariate n-class open source
	segmentation algorithm distributed with ANTs ( http://www.picsl.upenn.edu/ANTs
	). The Bayesian formulation of the segmentation problem is solved
	using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm with the modeling
	of the class intensities based on either parametric or non-parametric
	finite mixtures. Atropos is capable of incorporating spatial prior
	probability maps (sparse), prior label maps and/or Markov Random
	Field (MRF) modeling. Atropos has also been efficiently implemented
	to handle large quantities of possible labelings (in the experimental
	section, we use up to 69 classes) with a minimal memory footprint.
	This work describes the technical and implementation aspects of Atropos
	and evaluates its performance on two different ground-truth datasets.
	First, we use the BrainWeb dataset from Montreal Neurological Institute
	to evaluate three-tissue segmentation performance via (1) K-means
	segmentation without use of template data; (2) MRF segmentation with
	initialization by prior probability maps derived from a group template;
	(3) Prior-based segmentation with use of spatial prior probability
	maps derived from a group template. We also evaluate Atropos performance
	by using spatial priors to drive a 69-class EM segmentation problem
	derived from the Hammers atlas from University College London. These
	evaluation studies, combined with illustrative examples that exercise
	Atropos options, demonstrate both performance and wide applicability
	of this new platform-independent open source segmentation tool.},

	Abstract = {We evaluate the impact of template choice on template-based segmentation
	of the hippocampus in epilepsy. Four dataset-specific strategies
	are quantitatively contrasted: the "closest to average" individual
	template, the average shape version of the closest to average template,
	a best appearance template and the best appearance and shape template
	proposed here and implemented in the open source toolkit Advanced
	Normalization Tools (ANTS). The cross-correlation similarity metric
	drives the correspondence model and is used consistently to determine
	the optimal appearance. Minimum shape distance in the diffeomorphic
	space determines optimal shape. Our evaluation results show that,
	with respect to gold-standard manual labeling of hippocampi in epilepsy,
	optimal shape and appearance template construction outperforms the
	other strategies for gaining data-derived templates. Our results
	also show the improvement is most significant on the diseased side
	and insignificant on the healthy side. Thus, the importance of the
	template increases when used to study pathology and may be less critical
	for normal control studies. Furthermore, explicit geometric optimization
	of the shape component of the unbiased template positively impacts
	the study of diseased hippocampi.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent technical developments have made it feasible to comprehensively assess brain anatomy in psychiatric populations.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the structural brain alterations detected in the magnetic resonance images of a large series of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) using imaging procedures that allow the evaluation of volume changes throughout the brain.
DESIGN: Case-control study.
SETTING: Referral OCD unit in a tertiary hospital.
PARTICIPANTS: A consecutive sample of 72 outpatients with OCD and 72 age- and sex-matched control subjects.
INTERVENTIONS: Three-dimensional sequences were obtained in all participants. A statistical parametric mapping approach was used to delineate possible anatomical alterations in the entire brain. To preserve volumetric information, voxel values were modulated by the Jacobian determinants (volume change measurement) derived from spatial normalization.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Voxelwise brain volumes.
RESULTS: The brains of patients with OCD showed reduced gray matter volume in the medial frontal gyrus, the medial orbitofrontal cortex, and the left insulo-opercular region. A relative increase in gray matter volume was observed bilaterally in the ventral part of the putamen and in the anterior cerebellum. All these brain alterations were abnormally correlated in patients with OCD, and age statistically significantly contributed to the relative enlargement observed in the striatal areas. Disease severity, the nature of symptoms, and comorbidities were not related to the changes described. Nevertheless, patients with prominent aggressive obsessions and checking compulsions showed reduced amygdala volume in the right hemisphere.
CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of anatomical features depicted by this voxelwise approach is consistent with data from functional studies. The reported anatomical maps identified the specific parts of the frontostriatal system that were altered in patients with OCD and detected changes in anatomically connected distant regions. These data further define the structural brain alterations in OCD and may contribute to constraining the prevailing biological models of this psychiatric process.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Structural deficiencies within limbic and prefrontal regions may contribute to the characteristic drug-seeking and drug-taking behaviors that prevail in persons dependent on cocaine. To date, a focal structural analysis of the brains of cocaine patients has not been undertaken.
METHODS: We used voxel based morphometry in conjunction with statistical parametric mapping on the structural magnetic resonance images of cocaine-dependent (n = 13) and cocaine-naive individuals (n = 16) to assess differences between the two groups in gray and white matter concentration.
RESULTS: We report a decrease in gray matter concentration in the ventromedial orbitofrontal, anterior cingulate, anteroventral insular, and superior temporal cortices of cocaine patients in comparison to controls (p <.01 corrected for multiple comparisons). The average percentage decrease in gray matter concentration within a region ranged from 5% to 11%. White matter concentration did not differ between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the brains of cocaine patients are structurally dissimilar from those of nondrug-using controls. The differences were detected in regions involved in decision-making, behavioral inhibition and assignation of emotional valence to environmental stimuli and, hence, may contribute to some of the behavioral deficits characteristic of chronic cocaine users.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: To investigate in a large cohort of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), lesion load and atrophy evolution, and the relationship between clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) correlates of disease progression.
METHODS: Two hundred and sixty-seven patients with MS were studied at baseline and two years later using the same MRI protocol. Abnormal white matter fraction, normal appearing white matter fraction, global white matter fraction, gray matter fraction and whole brain fraction, T2-hyperintense, and T1-hypointense lesions were measured at both time points.
RESULTS: The majority of patients were clinically stable, whereas MRI-derived brain tissue fractions were significantly different after 2 years. The correlation between MRI data at baseline and their variation during the follow-up showed that lower basal gray matter atrophy was significantly related with higher progression of gray matter atrophy during follow-up. The correlation between MRI parameters and disease duration showed that gray matter atrophy rate decreased with increasing disease duration, whereas the rate of white matter atrophy had a constant pattern. Lower basal gray matter atrophy was associated with increased probability of developing gray matter atrophy at follow-up, whereas gray matter atrophy progression over 2 years and new T2 lesion load were risk factors for whole brain atrophy progression.
CONCLUSIONS: In MS, brain atrophy occurs even after a relatively short period of time and in patients with limited progression of disability. Short-term brain atrophy progression rates differ across tissue compartments, as gray matter atrophy results more pronounced than white matter atrophy and appears to be a early phenomenon in the MS-related disease progression.},

	Abstract = {The role of the brain in chronic pain conditions remains speculative. We compared brain morphology of 26 chronic back pain (CBP) patients to matched control subjects, using magnetic resonance imaging brain scan data and automated analysis techniques. CBP patients were divided into neuropathic, exhibiting pain because of sciatic nerve damage, and non-neuropathic groups. Pain-related characteristics were correlated to morphometric measures. Neocortical gray matter volume was compared after skull normalization. Patients with CBP showed 5-11% less neocortical gray matter volume than control subjects. The magnitude of this decrease is equivalent to the gray matter volume lost in 10-20 years of normal aging. The decreased volume was related to pain duration, indicating a 1.3 cm3 loss of gray matter for every year of chronic pain. Regional gray matter density in 17 CBP patients was compared with matched controls using voxel-based morphometry and nonparametric statistics. Gray matter density was reduced in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and right thalamus and was strongly related to pain characteristics in a pattern distinct for neuropathic and non-neuropathic CBP. Our results imply that CBP is accompanied by brain atrophy and suggest that the pathophysiology of chronic pain includes thalamocortical processes.},

	Abstract = {Neurodevelopmental models for the pathology of schizophrenia propose both polygenetic and environmental risks, as well as early (pre/perinatal) and late (usually adolescent) developmental brain abnormalities. With the use of brain mapping algorithms, we detected striking anatomical profiles of accelerated gray matter loss in very early-onset schizophrenia; surprisingly, deficits moved in a dynamic pattern, enveloping increasing amounts of cortex throughout adolescence. Early-onset patients were rescanned prospectively with MRI, at 2-year intervals at three time points, to uncover the dynamics and timing of disease progression during adolescence. The earliest deficits were found in parietal brain regions, supporting visuospatial and associative thinking, where adult deficits are known to be mediated by environmental (nongenetic) factors. Over 5 years, these deficits progressed anteriorly into temporal lobes, engulfing sensorimotor and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, and frontal eye fields. These emerging patterns correlated with psychotic symptom severity and mirrored the neuromotor, auditory, visual search, and frontal executive impairments in the disease. In temporal regions, gray matter loss was completely absent early in the disease but became pervasive later. Only the latest changes included dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and superior temporal gyri, deficit regions found consistently in adult studies. These emerging dynamic patterns were (i) controlled for medication and IQ effects, (ii) replicated in independent groups of males and females, and (iii) charted in individuals and groups. The resulting mapping strategy reveals a shifting pattern of tissue loss in schizophrenia. Aspects of the anatomy and dynamics of disease are uncovered, in a changing profile that implicates genetic and nongenetic patterns of deficits.},

	Abstract = {We detected and mapped a dynamically spreading wave of gray matter loss in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The loss pattern was visualized in four dimensions as it spread over time from temporal and limbic cortices into frontal and occipital brain regions, sparing sensorimotor cortices. The shifting deficits were asymmetric (left hemisphere > right hemisphere) and correlated with progressively declining cognitive status (p < 0.0006). Novel brain mapping methods allowed us to visualize dynamic patterns of atrophy in 52 high-resolution magnetic resonance image scans of 12 patients with AD (age 68.4 +/- 1.9 years) and 14 elderly matched controls (age 71.4 +/- 0.9 years) scanned longitudinally (two scans; interscan interval 2.1 +/- 0.4 years). A cortical pattern matching technique encoded changes in brain shape and tissue distribution across subjects and time. Cortical atrophy occurred in a well defined sequence as the disease progressed, mirroring the sequence of neurofibrillary tangle accumulation observed in cross sections at autopsy. Advancing deficits were visualized as dynamic maps that change over time. Frontal regions, spared early in the disease, showed pervasive deficits later (>15% loss). The maps distinguished different phases of AD and differentiated AD from normal aging. Local gray matter loss rates (5.3 +/- 2.3% per year in AD v 0.9 +/- 0.9% per year in controls) were faster in the left hemisphere (p < 0.029) than the right. Transient barriers to disease progression appeared at limbic/frontal boundaries. This degenerative sequence, observed in vivo as it developed, provides the first quantitative, dynamic visualization of cortical atrophic rates in normal elderly populations and in those with dementia.},

Recently, image processing techniques such as voxel-based morphometry (VBM) have been developed to provide an unbiased, visually informative, and comprehensive means of studying patterns of cerebral atrophy. We report the first study to use the voxel-based approach to assess patterns of cerebral atrophy in DLB compared to control subjects and AD.

Comparison of dementia groups showed preservation of the medial temporal lobe, hippocampus, and amygdala in DLB relative to AD.

Using a voxel-by-voxel morphometric technique, we found gray matter volume differences in motor, auditory, and visual-spatial brain regions when comparing professional musicians (keyboard players) with a matched group of amateur musicians and non-musicians. Although some of these multiregional differences could be attributable to innate predisposition, we believe they may represent structural adaptations in response to long-term skill acquisition and the repetitive rehearsal of those skills. This hypothesis is supported by the strong association we found between structural differences, musician status, and practice intensity, as well as the wealth of supporting animal data showing structural changes in response to long-term motor training. However, only future experiments can determine the relative contribution of predisposition and practice.},

@article{wright1995,
	Abstract = {We describe a novel technique for characterizing regional cerebral gray and white matter differences in structural magnetic resonance images by the application of methods derived from functional imaging. The technique involves automatic scalp-editing of images followed by segmentation, smoothing, and spatial normalization to a symmetrical template brain in stereotactic Talairach space. The basic idea is (i) to convert structural magnetic resonance image data into spatially normalized images of gray (or white) matter density, effected by segmenting the images and smoothing, and then (ii) to use Statistical Parametric Mapping to make inferences about the relationship between gray (or white) matter density and symptoms (or other pathophysiological measures) in a regionally specific fashion. Because the whole brain sum of gray (or white) matter indices is treated as a confound, the analysis reduces to a characterization of relative gray (or white) matter density on a voxel by voxel basis. We suggest that this is a powerful approach to voxel-based statistical anatomy. Using the technique, we constructed maps of the regional cerebral gray and white matter density correlates of syndrome scores (distinct psychotic symptoms) in a group of 15 schizophrenic patients. There was a negative correlation between the score for the reality distortion syndrome and regional gray matter density in the left superior temporal lobe (P = 0.01) and regional white matter density in the corpus callosum (P < 0.001). These abnormalities may be associated with functional changes predisposing to auditory hallucinations and delusions. This method permits the detection of structural differences within the entire brain (as opposed to selected regions of interest) and may be of value in the investigation of structural gray and white matter abnormalities in a variety of brain diseases.},

@article{Ashburner2000,
	Abstract = {At its simplest, voxel-based morphometry (VBM) involves a voxel-wise
	comparison of the local concentration of gray matter between two
	groups of subjects. The procedure is relatively straightforward and
	involves spatially normalizing high-resolution images from all the
	subjects in the study into the same stereotactic space. This is followed
	by segmenting the gray matter from the spatially normalized images
	and smoothing the gray-matter segments. Voxel-wise parametric statistical
	tests which compare the smoothed gray-matter images from the two
	groups are performed. Corrections for multiple comparisons are made
	using the theory of Gaussian random fields. This paper describes
	the steps involved in VBM, with particular emphasis on segmenting
	gray matter from MR images with nonuniformity artifact. We provide
	evaluations of the assumptions that underpin the method, including
	the accuracy of the segmentation and the assumptions made about the
	statistical distribution of the data.},

@article{Smith2006,
	Abstract = {There has been much recent interest in using magnetic resonance diffusion
	imaging to provide information about anatomical connectivity in the
	brain, by measuring the anisotropic diffusion of water in white matter
	tracts. One of the measures most commonly derived from diffusion
	data is fractional anisotropy (FA), which quantifies how strongly
	directional the local tract structure is. Many imaging studies are
	starting to use FA images in voxelwise statistical analyses, in order
	to localise brain changes related to development, degeneration and
	disease. However, optimal analysis is compromised by the use of standard
	registration algorithms; there has not to date been a satisfactory
	solution to the question of how to align FA images from multiple
	subjects in a way that allows for valid conclusions to be drawn from
	the subsequent voxelwise analysis. Furthermore, the arbitrariness
	of the choice of spatial smoothing extent has not yet been resolved.
	In this paper, we present a new method that aims to solve these issues
	via (a) carefully tuned non-linear registration, followed by (b)
	projection onto an alignment-invariant tract representation (the
	"mean FA skeleton"). We refer to this new approach as Tract-Based
	Spatial Statistics (TBSS). TBSS aims to improve the sensitivity,
	objectivity and interpretability of analysis of multi-subject diffusion
	imaging studies. We describe TBSS in detail and present example TBSS
	results from several diffusion imaging studies.},

	Abstract = {A neuroscientific experiment typically generates a large amount of data, of which only a small fraction is analyzed in detail and presented in a publication. However, selection among noisy measurements can render circular an otherwise appropriate analysis and invalidate results. Here we argue that systems neuroscience needs to adjust some widespread practices to avoid the circularity that can arise from selection. In particular, 'double dipping', the use of the same dataset for selection and selective analysis, will give distorted descriptive statistics and invalid statistical inference whenever the results statistics are not inherently independent of the selection criteria under the null hypothesis. To demonstrate the problem, we apply widely used analyses to noise data known to not contain the experimental effects in question. Spurious effects can appear in the context of both univariate activation analysis and multivariate pattern-information analysis. We suggest a policy for avoiding circularity.},

@article{Vul2009,
	Abstract = {{Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studiesofemotion, personality, and social cognition have drawn much attention in recent years, with high-profile studies frequently reporting extremely high (e.g., >.8) correlations between brain activation and personality measures. We show that these correlations are higher than should be expected given the (evidently limited) reliability of both fMRI and personality measures. The high correlations are all the more puzzling because method sections rarely contain much detail about how the correlations were obtained. We surveyed authors of 55 articles that reported findings of this kind to determine a few details on how these correlations were computed. More than half acknowledged using a strategy that computes separate correlations for individual voxels and reports means of only those voxels exceeding chosen thresholds. We show how this nonindependent analysis inflates correlations while yielding reassuring-looking scattergrams. This analysis technique was used to obtain the vast majority of the implausibly high correlations in our survey sample. In addition, we argue that, in some cases, other analysis problems likely created entirely spurious correlations. We outline how the data from these studies could be reanalyzed with unbiased methods to provide accurate estimates of the correlations in question and urge authors to perform such reanalyses. The underlying problems described here appear to be common in fMRI research of many kinds---not just in studies of emotion, personality, and social cognition.}},

	Abstract = {In this article, we accomplish two things. First, we show that despite empirical psychologists' nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings (≤ .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process.},
